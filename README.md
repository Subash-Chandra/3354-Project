Is This Even Real?

Project Title: ‘Human or AI?’ Turing Test Art Challenge

Project Description: A full-stack application (executable or web-contained) which challenges users to discriminate 
between computer-generated works of art and the pre-existing works of human artists.

Tasks: 
- Building both (the AI generation, and human artwork) databases or retrieval systems.
- Building the art generation module.
- Prototype front-end
- Designing game modes, including front end components
- Polished GUI with fast response time

Front-End: A GUI that includes a main menu with game mode listings (TBD), as well as options, leaderboards, and login screens

Back-End: The necessary components will include but may not be limited to: 
- Human DB: A database of human-produced artwork (or a method for retrieving such artwork from the web)
- AI DB: Of similar structure to the Human DB, a database or retrieval system of photography to use as raw material for the AI artwork generator
- Art Generator: a module that interacts directly with the fast-neural-style library to produce the desired image alteration
- Game Mode Parent Module: Consisting of multiple sub-modules, each of which supports a single game mode, and possibly game modes played between multiple players

Schedule and Timeline:
Delivery of the final product is estimated to occur approximately 6-12 weeks after the date listed on this Statement of Work. 
However, please be advised: this is an estimate, and requests for additional functionality (or removal of functionality) may 
require renegotiation of the time frame of the project. All additional requests outside the scope of this document can be agreed 
upon verbally or in writing. 
All work performed in relation to this project will take place either in person, or online through Discord, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, GitHub, and Google Drive.
